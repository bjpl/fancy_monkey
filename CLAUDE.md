## 🔄 MANDATORY FILE READING PROTOCOL

**When you need detailed information, you MUST read the appropriate file:**

### Read FANCY_MONKEY_PRACTICES.md when:
- Implementing architecture decisions (vanilla JS, serverless, etc.)
- Working with brand guidelines or UX requirements
- Implementing error handling or fallback systems
- Optimizing performance or implementing monitoring
- Setting up security measures or input sanitization
- Creating tests or deployment procedures
- Making any architectural or design decisions
- User asks about "how should I implement X"
- User asks about "best practices for Y"
- You need detailed implementation guidance

**Command to read:** Use the Read tool on `FANCY_MONKEY_PRACTICES.md`

### Read AGENT_DIRECTIVES.md when:
- User asks about universal agent directives
- Need to copy directives to another project
- Reviewing complete directive documentation
- User asks "what are the agent operating instructions"

**Command to read:** Use the Read tool on `AGENT_DIRECTIVES.md`

### Read daily_reports/ when:
- User asks about project history
- Need to understand past decisions
- Reviewing what was accomplished on specific dates
- User asks "what did we do on [date]"

**Command to read:** Use the Read tool on `daily_reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**⚠️ DO NOT GUESS** - If you need detailed information not in this file, READ the appropriate file first.

**📢 PROTOCOL:** When reading detailed files, announce to the user:
- "Reading FANCY_MONKEY_PRACTICES.md for detailed [topic] guidance..."
- "Checking AGENT_DIRECTIVES.md for complete directive documentation..."
- "Reading daily report for [date] to understand project history..."

This ensures transparency about information sources and confirms you're following the protocol.

## 🎯 Project-Specific Implementation

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: The summaries below are HIGH-LEVEL ONLY.**

**📖 For detailed implementation guidance, you MUST read FANCY_MONKEY_PRACTICES.md using the Read tool.**

**DO NOT implement features based on these summaries alone. Always read the detailed guide first.**

### Brand Guidelines (MANDATORY-19: User Experience)
- **Tone:** Playful, fun, professional
- **Visual Theme:** Monkey/banana themed with warm colors
- **Error Messages:** On-brand ("banana break", "monkey business")
- **Accessibility:** All playful elements have accessible alternatives

### Error Handling (MANDATORY-7: Error Handling)
1. Never show broken state - Always have fallbacks
2. On-brand messaging - Keep errors fun but informative
3. Multiple fallback layers - Primary → Secondary → Manual
4. User guidance - Always provide next steps

**Example Fallback Chain:**
- Primary: Stripe checkout → Error detected
- Secondary: Redirect to fallback checkout page
- Tertiary: Manual order form with email notification
- Final: Contact support with order details

### Performance Targets (MANDATORY-14: Performance Awareness)
- Page load: < 2 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: < 1 second
- Bundle size: < 100KB compressed
- Images: WebP + PNG/JPG fallbacks, lazy loading

### Security (MANDATORY-9: Security & Privacy)
- All secrets in environment variables (never commit)
- Server-side price validation via Stripe
- Input sanitization on all user inputs
- Principle of least privilege

### Architecture Decisions (MANDATORY-10: Architecture & Design)

**Vanilla JavaScript chosen for:**
- Fast load times (<2s target)
- Zero build complexity
- Direct GitHub Pages deployment
- Full performance control

**When to reconsider:**
- Catalog exceeds 1000 products
- Complex state management needed
- Team prefers framework structure
